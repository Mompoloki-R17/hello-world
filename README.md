# hello-world
Ok, i'ts like my Billion Hello World, this is getting old.

I'm being force to do this, I'm not saying I don't like cause i LOVE it. 

Ok, a bit about myself, I graduated with two degrees, Mining Engineering and Economics.
Had I known what i know now, I'd have quit varsity like the first day, well too bad it didn't happen.
I'm glad and thankful though, cause I could have been a quitter....

Enough with this nonsense....I'm WIDE AWAKE NOW, that's all that matters.
